# Purpose

This library makes it easy to incorporate **sheet music** into your **websites**. 

## Uses

* Draw arbitrary sheet music.

* Instantly modify the music.

* Do animation effects with the drawn music.

* Style the music using CSS.

* Create synthesized audio for the music.

* Search for **ABC** formatted strings on a webpage (for instance in post or comments on a blog) and turn them into sheet music.

* Allow the user to modify the music instantly by typing an **ABC** string.

## NOT

* It does not provide a visual editor (although it could be used as a basis if you want to write one.)

## Browser/device support

* The visual part of this library is supported from IE9 and newer, Safari 5.1 and newer, and all modern browsers.

* This synth audio part of this library does not work on IE, but works on any system that supports `AudioContext.resume` and `Promises`. That is, any browser newer than Firefox 40, Safari 9.1, Edge 13, and Chrome 43.
